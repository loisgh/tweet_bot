This application validates TweetSec passwords. 
You can run the script by invoking the check_password_strength method with a string password parameter. 
There are some examples of this at the bottom of the file.  

In this version, I have implemented a full dictionary function.  The dictionary is the standard one that
comes with mac's or linux.  It's located at '/usr/share/dict/words'.
